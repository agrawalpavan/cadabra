This is the Windows version of the "Caltech Automated Drosophila 
Aggression-Courtship Behavioral Repertoire Analysis (CADABRA)". 
The software consists of the tracking module "Qtrak" and the 
behavior analysis module "ANALYSIS".

CADABRA 1.0 needs either Matlab 2008b or the Matlab 2008b Runtime 
library installed before running it.

The software consists of two main modules, "QTrak" and "Analysis".

1) "QTrak" is a tracking software for pairs of fruit flies.

2) "Analysis" processes the output of QTrak in order to detect and 
analyze aggressive behaviors, locotmotion as well as courthsip behaviors.
- The code for the GUI is located in 'analysis.m' and 'border.m'. 
- The processing itself starts with 'main_anlysis.m'
