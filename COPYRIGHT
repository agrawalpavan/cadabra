This is the Windows version of the "Caltech Automated Drosophila 
Aggression-Courtship Behavioral Repertoire Analysis (CADABRA)". 

CADABRA 1.0 needs either Matlab 2008b or the Matlab 2008b Runtime 
library installed. Additionally either Microsoft Visual Studio or 
the Redistributable need to be installed before running CADABRA. 
The Runtime versions are provided under

The software consists of two modules: the tracking module 
"QTRAK" and the behavior analysis module "ANALYSIS".

1) "QTRAK" is a tracking software for pairs of fruit flies.

2) "ANALYSIS" processes the output of QTRAK in order to detect and 
analyze aggressive behaviors, locotmotion as well as courthsip behaviors.
- The code for the GUI is located in 'analysis.m' and 'border.m'. 
- The processing itself starts with 'main_anlysis.m'
